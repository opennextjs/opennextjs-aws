The image optimization backend is used to transform images to the desired format and quality. 
It should be accessible at `/_next/image?url=URL_OF_THE_IMAGE&q=QUALITY&w=WIDTH` and should be used as a proxy to the image source.

### Environment Variables
  - BUCKET_NAME: The name of the bucket where the images are stored
  - BUCKET_KEY_PREFIX: The prefix of the key where the images are stored

### Special Overrides

#### Loader
It is used to load **internal** images. By default, it uses S3 API to load the images from the bucket.

You can customize the loader by providing a custom loader function to the `loader` prop.
It should return 
```typescript
type ImageLoader = BaseOverride & {
  load: (url: string) => Promise<{
    body?: Readable;
    contentType?: string;
    cacheControl?: string;
  }>;
}
```
