The Initializer is a special backend that should run only once during deployment. It's default role is to populate the tag cache with the prerendered tags.

It uses these events and results: 
```typescript
interface InitializationFunctionEvent {
  type: "initializationFunction";
  requestType: "create" | "update" | "delete";
  resourceId: typeof PHYSICAL_RESOURCE_ID;
}

type InitializationFunctionResult = InitializationFunctionEvent;
```

### Special Overrides

The initializer uses the tag cache to store the prerendered tags.
