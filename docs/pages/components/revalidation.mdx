The revalidation backend is used to read the queue and revalidate the routes. It is used for ISR only.
For every received message it will trigger a `HEAD` request with `x-prerender-revalidate` header to the host.

### Special Event and Result types
```typescript
interface RevalidateEvent {
  type: "revalidate";
  records: {
    host: string;
    url: string;
  }[];
}
 interface RevalidateResult {
  type: "revalidate";
 }
```
