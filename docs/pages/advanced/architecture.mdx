## Recommended infrastructure on AWS

OpenNext does not create the underlying infrastructure. You can create the infrastructure for your app with your preferred tool â€” SST, AWS CDK, Terraform, Serverless Framework, etc.

This is the recommended setup.

</p>

Here are the recommended configurations for each AWS resource.

#### Asset files

Create an S3 bucket and upload the content in the `.open-next/assets` folder to the root of the bucket. For example, the file `.open-next/assets/favicon.ico` should be uploaded to `/favicon.ico` at the root of the bucket. If you need to upload the files to a subfolder within the bucket, [refer to this section](options#reusing-same-bucket-for-asset-and-cache).

There are two types of files in the `.open-next/assets` folder:

**Hashed files**

These are files with a hash component in the file name. Hashed files are be found in the `.open-next/assets/_next` folder, such as `.open-next/assets/_next/static/css/0275f6d90e7ad339.css`. The hash values in the filenames are guaranteed to change when the content of the files is modified. Therefore, hashed files should be cached both at the CDN level and at the browser level. When uploading the hashed files to S3, the recommended cache control setting is

```
public,max-age=31536000,immutable
```

**Un-hashed files**

Other files inside the `.open-next/assets` folder are copied from your app's `public/` folder, such as `.open-next/assets/favicon.ico`. The filename for un-hashed files may remain unchanged when the content is modified. Un-hashed files should be cached at the CDN level, but not at the browser level. When the content of un-hashed files is modified, the CDN cache should be invalidated on deploy. When uploading the un-hashed files to S3, the recommended cache control setting is

```
public,max-age=0,s-maxage=31536000,must-revalidate
```

#### Cache files

Create an S3 bucket and upload the content in the `.open-next/cache` folder to the root of the bucket. If you need to upload the files to a subfolder within the bucket, [refer to this section](options#reusing-same-bucket-for-asset-and-cache).

There are two types of caches in the `.open-next/cache` folder:

- Route cache: This cache includes `html` and `json` files that are prerendered during the build. They are used to seed the revalidation cache.
- Fetch cache: This cache includes fetch call responses, which might contain sensitive information. Make sure these files are not publicly accessible.

#### Revalidation Table

Create a DynamoDB table with the following configuration:
- Partition key: `tag` (String)
- Sort key: `path` (String)
- An index named `revalidate` with the following configuration:
  - Partition key: `path` (String)
  - Sort key: `revalidatedAt` (Number)

#### Image optimization function

Create a Lambda function using the code in the `.open-next/image-optimization-function` folder, with the handler `index.mjs`. Also, ensure that the function is configured as follows:

- Set the architecture to `arm64`.
- Set the `BUCKET_NAME` environment variable with the value being the name of the S3 bucket where the original images are stored.
- Set the `BUCKET_KEY_PREFIX` environment variable if the asset files are uploaded to a subfolder in the S3 bucket. The value is the path to the folder. This is Optional.
- Grant `s3:GetObject` permission.

This function handles image optimization requests when the Next.js `<Image>` component is used. The [sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) library, which is bundled with the function, is used to convert the image. The library is compiled against the `arm64` architecture and is intended to run on AWS Lambda Arm/Graviton2 architecture. [Learn about the better cost-performance offered by AWS Graviton2 processors.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-lambda-functions-powered-by-aws-graviton2-processor-run-your-functions-on-arm-and-get-up-to-34-better-price-performance/)

Note that the image optimization function responds with the `Cache-Control` header, so the image will be cached both at the CDN level and at the browser level.

#### Server Lambda function

Create a Lambda function using the code in the `.open-next/server-function` folder, with the handler `index.mjs`. Also, ensure that the function is configured as follows:

- Set the `CACHE_BUCKET_NAME` environment variable with the value being the name of the S3 bucket where the cache files are stored.
- Set the `CACHE_BUCKET_KEY_PREFIX` environment variable if the cache files are uploaded to a subfolder in the S3 bucket. The value is the path to the folder. This is optional.
- Set the `CACHE_BUCKET_REGION` environment variable with the value being the region of the S3 bucket.
- Set the `REVALIDATION_QUEUE_URL` environment variable with the value being the URL of the revalidation queue.
- Set the `REVALIDATION_QUEUE_REGION` environment variable with the value being the region of the revalidation queue.
- Set the `CACHE_DYNAMO_TABLE` environment variable with the value being the name of the revalidation table.
- Grant `s3:GetObject`, `s3:PutObject`, and `s3:ListObjects` permission.
- Grant `sqs:SendMessage` permission.

This function handles all other types of requests from the Next.js app, including Server-side Rendering (SSR) requests and API requests. OpenNext builds the Next.js app in **standalone** mode. The standalone mode generates a `.next` folder containing the **NextServer** class that handles requests and a `node_modules` folder with **all the dependencies** needed to run the `NextServer`. The structure looks like this:

```
  .next/                -> NextServer
  node_modules/         -> dependencies
```

The server function adapter wraps around `NextServer` and exports a handler function that supports the Lambda request and response. The `server-function` bundle looks like this:

```diff
  .next/                -> NextServer
+ .open-next/
  node_modules/         -> dependencies
+ index.mjs             -> server function adapter
```

**Monorepo**

In the case of a monorepo, the build output looks slightly different. For example, if the app is located in `packages/web`, the build output looks like this:

```
  packages/
    web/
      .next/            -> NextServer
      node_modules/     -> dependencies from root node_modules (optional)
  node_modules/         -> dependencies from package node_modules
```

In this case, the server function adapter needs to be created inside `packages/web` next to `.next/`. This is to ensure that the adapter can import dependencies from both `node_modules` folders. It is not a good practice to have the Lambda configuration coupled with the project structure, so instead of setting the Lambda handler to `packages/web/index.mjs`, we will add a wrapper `index.mjs` at the `server-function` bundle root that re-exports the adapter. The resulting structure looks like this:

```diff
  packages/
    web/
      .next/                -> NextServer
+     .open-next/
      node_modules/          -> dependencies from root node_modules (optional)
+     index.mjs              -> server function adapter
  node_modules/              -> dependencies from package node_modules
+ index.mjs                  -> adapter wrapper
```

This ensures that the Lambda handler remains at `index.mjs`.

#### CloudFront distribution

Create a CloudFront distribution, and dispatch requests to their corresponding handlers (behaviors). The following behaviors are configured:

| Behavior                                                                                                                      | Requests            | CloudFront Function                                                                         | Origin                      |

#### Running at edge

The server function can also run at edge locations by configuring it as Lambda@Edge on Origin Request. The server function can accept both regional request events (API payload version 2.0) and edge request events (CloudFront Origin Request payload). Depending on the shape of the Lambda event object, the function will process the request accordingly.

To configure the CloudFront distribution:

| Behavior                                                                                                                      | Requests            | CloudFront Function                                                                         | Lambda@Edge     | Origin                      |

#### Revalidation function

Create a Lambda function using the code in the `.open-next/revalidation-function` folder, with the handler `index.mjs`.

Also, create an SQS FIFO queue, and set it as the event source for this function.

This function polls the queue for revalidation messages. Upon receiving a message, the function sends a HEAD request to the specified route for its revalidation.

#### Warmer function

Create a Lambda function using the code in the `.open-next/warmer-function` folder, with the handler `index.mjs`. Ensure the function is configured as follows:

- Set the `FUNCTION_NAME` environment variable with the value being the name of the server Lambda function.
- Set the `CONCURRENCY` environment variable with the value being the number of server functions to warm.
- Grant `lambda:InvokeFunction` permission to allow the warmer to invoke the server function.

Also, create an EventBridge scheduled rule to invoke the warmer function every 5 minutes.

Read more on [how warming works](/inner_workings/warming).

#### Dynamo Provider Function

This function is used to populate the revalidation table. It is a custom resource handler from the cdk see [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-cdk-lib.custom_resources.AwsCustomResource.html). Ensure the function is configured as follows:

- Set the `CACHE_DYNAMO_TABLE` environment variable with the value being the name of the DynamoDB table where the revalidation table is stored.
- Grant `dynamodb:PutItem` permission to allow the function to write to the DynamoDB table.
