#### Function logs

To find the **server, image optimization, and warmer log**, go to the AWS CloudWatch console in the **region you deployed to**.

If the server function is **deployed to Lambda@Edge**, the logs will appear in the **region you are physically close to**. For example, if you deployed your app to `us-east-1` and you are visiting the app from in London, the logs are likely to be in `eu-west-2`.

#### Warmer function logs

The logs from the warmer function provide insights into the results of the warming process.

```
{ event: 'warmer result', sent: 2, success: 2, uniqueServersWarmed: 2 }
```

- `sent` — The number of times the warmer invoked the server function using the Lambda SDK. This value should correspond to the `CONCURRENCY` set in the warmer function.
- `success` — The number of SDK calls that returned a 200 status code, indicating successful invocations.
- `uniqueServersWarmed` — This helps track any instances that responded unusually quickly and served multiple warming requests. As all SDK calls are made concurrently using `await Promise.all()`, this metric is useful for monitoring the number of unique warmed instances.

#### Opening an issue

To help diagnose issues, it's always helpful to provide a reproducible setup when opening an issue. One easy way to do this is to create a pull request (PR) and add a new page to the [benchmark app](#example) located in the `example` folder, which reproduces the issue. The PR will automatically deploy the app to AWS.
