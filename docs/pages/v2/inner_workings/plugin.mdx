import { Callout } from "nextra/components";

Open-next use esbuild to build the project. Given that we aim to support multiple version of Next and multiple runtime, we developped a plugin to override some parts of our code at build time with an esbuild plugin.

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  As of now, the plugin is internal and not exposed to the user.
  We might expose it in the future, but for now, it is used only internally.
</Callout>

#### How to use

You need to create a ts file where you will override the code. Inside this file, you can use the following syntax:

```ts
//#import
// Everything inside here will be placed at the top of the file
const test = "test";
//#endImport


//#override import
// Everything inside here will replace the content of the override with the given id: import
// To get the id you'll need to look at the file you want to override
import { requestHandler } from "./util.js";
//#endOverride

//#override fnId
// Everything inside here will replace the content of the override with the given id: fnId
export const fnId = (req: IncomingMessage, res: ServerResponse) => {
  requestHandler(req, res);
};
//#endOverride
```

and then you use the plugin this way:

```ts
import openNextPlugin from "./plugin.js";

openNextPlugin({
  name: "name of the plugin",
  target: /plugins\/serverHandler\.js/g, // regex to match the file to override
  replacements: ["./serverHandler.replacement.js"], // path to the files containing the overrides
}),

```

#### Known issues

Do not include `types` in #override and #imports, as esbuild will remove preceeding comments (ie it removes //#override id)when it builds.

Instead, put the `import type` outside like:

```
import type { PluginHandler } from "../next-types.js";
import type { IncomingMessage } from "../request.js";
import type { ServerResponse } from "../response.js";

//#override imports
import { requestHandler } from "./util.js";
//#endOverride
```

The types are removed in the final output anyways.
