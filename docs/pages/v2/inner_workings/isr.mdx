In standalone mode, Next.js prebuilds the ISR cache during the build process. And at runtime, **NextServer** expects this cache locally on the server. This works effectively when the server is run on a single web server machine, sharing the cache across all requests. In a Lambda environment, the cache needs to be housed centrally in a location accessible by all server Lambda function instances. S3 serves as this central location.

To facilitate this:

- ISR cache files are excluded from the `server-function` bundle and instead are uploaded to the cache bucket.
- The default cache handler is replaced with a custom cache handler by configuring the [`incrementalCacheHandlerPath`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/next-config-js/incrementalCacheHandlerPath) field in `next.config.js`.
- The custom cache handler manages the cache files on S3, handling both reading and writing operations.
- Since we're using FIFO queue, if we want to process more than one revalidation at a time, we need to have separate Message Group IDs. We generate a Message Group ID for each revalidation request based on the route path. This ensures that revalidation requests for the same route are processed only once. You can use `MAX_REVALIDATE_CONCURRENCY` environment variable to control the number of revalidation requests processed at a time. By default, it is set to 10.
- The `revalidation-function` polls the message from the queue and makes a `HEAD` request to the route with the `x-prerender-revalidate` header.
- The `server-function` receives the `HEAD` request and revalidates the cache.
- Tags are handled differently in a dynamodb table. We use a separate table to store the tags for each route. The custom cache handler will update the tags in the table when it updates the cache.

#### Lifetime of an ISR request for a stale page

1. Cloudfront receives a request for a page. Let's assume the page is stale in Cloudfront.
2. Cloudfront forwards the request to the `server-function` in the background but still returns the cached version.
3. The `server-function` checks in the S3 cache. If the page is stale, it sends the stale response back to Cloudfront while sending a message to the revalidation queue to trigger background revalidation. It will also change the cache-control header to `s-maxage=2, stale-while-revalidate=2592000`
4. A new request comes in for the same page after 2 seconds. Cloudfront sends the cached version back to the user and forwards the request to the `server-function`.
5. If the revalidation is done, the `server-function` will update the cache and send the updated response back to Cloudfront. Subsequent request will then get the updated version. Otherwise, we go back to step 3.

#### Tags 

Tags are stored in a dynamodb table. 
There is 3 fields in the table: `tag`, `path`, `revalidatedAt`. The `tag` field is the partition key and `path` is the sort key.

We use an index called `revalidate` with `path` as a partition key and `revalidatedAt` as the sort key.

Each tags has several paths, and every subpath is also considered as a tag. For example, if we have a tag `tag1` with path `/a/b/c`, we also have tags `/a`, `/a/layout`, `/a/page`, `/a/b`, `/a/b/layout`, `/a/b/page`, `/a/b/c/layout`, `/a/b/c/page`.

When `revalidateTag` is called, we update the `revalidatedAt` value for each path and subpath associated with this tag.

When we check if a page is stale, we check the `revalidatedAt` value for each record and the `LastModified` of this S3 cache objects . If `revalidatedAt` is greater than `LastModified`, we consider the page is stale.

#### Cost

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Be aware that fetch cache is using S3. `fetch` by default in next is cached, and even for SSR requests, it will be written to S3. This can lead to a lot of S3 requests and can be expensive. You can disable fetch cache by setting `cache` to `no-store` in the `fetch` options. Also see [this workaround](/common_issues/isr#patch-fetch-behaviour-for-isr-only-for-next1351)
</Callout>

`get` will be called on every request to ISR and SSG that are not cached in Cloudfront, and `set` will be called on every revalidation.
They can also be called on fetch requests if the `cache` option is not set to `no-store`.

There is also some cost associated to deployment since you need to upload the cache to S3 and upload the tags to DynamoDB.

For the examples here, let's assume an app route with a 5 minute revalidation delay in us-east-1. This is assuming you get constant traffic to the route (If you get no traffic, you will only pay for the storage cost).

##### S3
- Each `get` request to the cache will result in at least 1 `GetObject`

```
  GetObject cost - 8,640 requests * $0.0004 per 1,000 requests  = $0.003456
  Total cost - $0.003456 per route per month
```

- Each `set` request to the cache will result in 1 `PutObject` in S3

```
  PutObject cost - 8,640 requests * $0.005 per 1,000 requests = $0.0432
  Total cost - $0.0432 per route per month
```

You can then calculate the cost based on your usage and the [S3 pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/)

##### DynamoDB

For the example, let's consider that that same route has 2 tags and 10 paths and subpath for each tag. This is assuming you get constant traffic to the route.

- Each `revalidateTag` request will result in 1 `Query` in DynamoDB and a `PutItem` for each path associated with the tag, they are grouped in batches of 25 in a `BatchWriteItem` request.
```
  Assuming you do 1 revalidation per 5 minute
  Query cost - 8,640 request * $0.25 per 1,000,000 read = $0.00216
  BatchWriteItem cost - 86,400 requests * $0.25 per 1,000,000 write = $0.0216
  Total cost - $0.04536 per tag revalidation per month
```
- Each `get` request will result in 1 `Query` in DynamoDB
```
  Query cost - 8,640 request * $0.25 per 1,000,000 read = $0.00216
  Total cost - $0.00216 per route per month
```
- Each `set` request will result in 1 `Query` in DynamoDB and a `PutItem` for each tag associated with the path that are not present in DynamoDB, they are grouped in batches of 25 in a `BatchWriteItem` request.
```
  Query cost - 8,640 request * $0.25 per 1,000,000 read = $0.00216
  Total cost - $0.00216 per route per month
```

You can then calculate the cost based on your usage and the [DynamoDB pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/pricing/)
