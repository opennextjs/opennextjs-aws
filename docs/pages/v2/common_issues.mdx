#### Cannot find module next

You might stumble upon this error inside cloudwatch logs: `Cannot find module 'next'`.
It is likely that you are in a monorepo and you have several lock files.
Just make sure that you have a single lock file in the root of your project.

#### headers, redirect, rewrites in `next-config` and middleware are not working in next 13.4.12+

If you use a version of nextjs >= 13.4.12, you'll need to use an open-next version >= 2.1

#### My api route are returning empty response and i'm using sentry

If you are using sentry, API routes returns empty body. You could try configuring sentry to ignore API routes. You can read more about it [here](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/javascript/guides/nextjs/manual-setup/?opt-out-of-auto-instrumentation-on-specific-routes)

#### My ISR page has this cache-control header `s-maxage=2, stale-while-revalidate=2592000`

Given how ISR works, while waiting for the revalidation to happen, the page will be served using this cache control header. This prevent your server from being overloaded by a lot of requests while the revalidation is done. You can read more about it [here](/inner_workings/isr).

#### Unzipped size must be smaller than 262144000 bytes

AWS Lambda has an unzipped size limit of 250MB. If your app is over this limit, then it is most likely using a node_module library that is too large for serverless or there is a large dev dependency getting bundled.
For example, `pdfjs` has `canvas` optional dependency which takes up 180MB. For more details, [read me](/common_issues/bundle_size).
Note: a large bundle size will increase cold start significantly.
