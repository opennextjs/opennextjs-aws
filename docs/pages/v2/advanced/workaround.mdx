#### WORKAROUND: Create one cache behavior per top-level file and folder in `public/` (AWS specific)

As mentioned in the [Asset files](./architecture#asset-files) section, files in your app's `public/` folder are static and are uploaded to the S3 bucket. And requests for these files are handled by the S3 bucket, like so:

```
https://my-nextjs-app.com/favicon.ico
https://my-nextjs-app.com/my-images/avatar.png
```

Ideally, we would create a single cache behavior that routes all requests for `public/` files to the S3 bucket. Unfortunately, CloudFront does not support regex or advanced string patternss for cache behaviors (ie. `/favicon.ico|my-images\/*/` ).

To work around this limitation, we create a separate cache behavior for each top-level file and folder in `public/`. For example, if your folder structure is:

```
public/
  favicon.ico
  my-images/
    avatar.png
    avatar-dark.png
  foo/
    bar.png
```

You would create three cache behaviors: `/favicon.ico`, `/my-images/*`, and `/foo/*`. Each of these behaviors points to the S3 bucket.

One thing to be aware of is that CloudFront has a [default limit of 25 behaviors per distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html#limits-web-distributions). If you have a lot of top-level files and folders, you may reach this limit. To avoid this, consider moving some or all files and folders into a subdirectory:

```
public/
  files/
    favicon.ico
    my-images/
      avatar.png
      avatar-dark.png
    foo/
      bar.png
```

In this case, you only need to create one cache behavior: `/files/*`.

Make sure to update your code accordingly to reflect the new file paths.

Alternatively, you can [request an increase to the limit through AWS Support](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home#/case/create?issueType=service-limit-increase&limitType=service-code-cloudfront-distributions).

#### WORKAROUND: Set `x-forwarded-host` header (AWS specific)

When the server function receives a request, the `host` value in the Lambda request header is set to the hostname of the AWS Lambda service instead of the actual frontend hostname. This creates an issue for the server function (middleware, SSR routes, or API routes) when it needs to know the frontend host.

To work around the issue, a CloudFront function is run on Viewer Request, which sets the frontend hostname as the `x-forwarded-host` header. The function code looks like this:

```ts
function handler(event) {
  var request = event.request;
  request.headers["x-forwarded-host"] = request.headers.host;
  return request;
}
```

The server function would then sets the `host` header of the request to the value of the `x-forwarded-host` header when sending the request to the `NextServer`.

#### WORKAROUND: Set `NextRequest` geolocation data

When your application is hosted on Vercel, you can access a user's geolocation inside your middleware through the `NextRequest` object.

```ts
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  request.geo.country;
  request.geo.city;
}
```

When your application is hosted on AWS, you can [obtain the geolocation data from CloudFront request headers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/adding-cloudfront-headers.html#cloudfront-headers-viewer-location). However, there is no way to set this data on the `NextRequest` object passed to the middleware function.

To work around the issue, the `NextRequest` constructor is modified to initialize geolocation data from CloudFront headers, instead of using the default empty object.

```diff
- geo: init.geo || {}
+ geo: init.geo || {
+   country: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-country"),
+   countryName: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-country-name"),
+   region: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-country-region"),
+   regionName: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-country-region-name"),
+   city: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-city"),
+   postalCode: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-postal-code"),
+   timeZone: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-time-zone"),
+   latitude: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-latitude"),
+   longitude: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-longitude"),
+   metroCode: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-metro-code"),
+ }
```

CloudFront provides more detailed geolocation information, such as postal code and timezone. Here is a complete list of `geo` properties available in your middleware:

```ts
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Supported by Next.js
  request.geo.country;
  request.geo.region;
  request.geo.city;
  request.geo.latitude;
  request.geo.longitude;

  // Also supported by OpenNext
  request.geo.countryName;
  request.geo.regionName;
  request.geo.postalCode;
  request.geo.timeZone;
  request.geo.metroCode;
}
```

#### WORKAROUND: `NextServer` does not set cache headers for HTML pages

As mentioned in the [Server function](./architecture#server-lambda-function) section, the server function uses the `NextServer` class from Next.js' build output to handle requests. However, `NextServer` does not seem to set the correct `Cache Control` headers.

To work around the issue, the server function checks if the request is for an HTML page, and sets the `Cache Control` header to:

```
public, max-age=0, s-maxage=31536000, must-revalidate
```

#### WORKAROUND: `NextServer` does not set correct SWR cache headers

`NextServer` does not seem to set an appropriate value for the `stale-while-revalidate` cache header. For example, the header might look like this:

```
s-maxage=600 stale-while-revalidate
```

This prevents CloudFront from caching the stale data.

To work around the issue, the server function checks if the response includes the `stale-while-revalidate` header. If found, it sets the value to 30 days:

```
s-maxage=600 stale-while-revalidate=2592000
```

#### WORKAROUND: Set `NextServer` working directory (AWS specific)

Next.js recommends using `process.cwd()` instead of `__dirname` to get the app directory. For example, consider a `posts` folder in your app with markdown files:

```
pages/
posts/
  my-post.md
public/
next.config.js
package.json
```

You can build the file path like this:

```ts
path.join(process.cwd(), "posts", "my-post.md");
```

As mentioned in the [Server function](./architecture#server-lambda-function) section, in a non-monorepo setup, the `server-function` bundle looks like:

```
.next/
node_modules/
posts/
  my-post.md    <- path is "posts/my-post.md"
index.mjs
```

In this case, `path.join(process.cwd(), "posts", "my-post.md")` resolves to the correct path.

However, when the user's app is inside a monorepo (ie. at `/packages/web`), the `server-function` bundle looks like:

```
packages/
  web/
    .next/
    node_modules/
    posts/
      my-post.md    <- path is "packages/web/posts/my-post.md"
    index.mjs
node_modules/
index.mjs
```

In this case, `path.join(process.cwd(), "posts", "my-post.md")` cannot be resolved.

To work around the issue, we change the working directory for the server function to where `.next/` is located, ie. `packages/web`.

#### WORKAROUND: Set `__NEXT_PRIVATE_PREBUNDLED_REACT` to use prebundled React

For Next.js 13.2 and later versions, you need to explicitly set the `__NEXT_PRIVATE_PREBUNDLED_REACT` environment variable. Although this environment variable isn't documented at the time of writing, you can refer to the Next.js source code to understand its usage:

> In standalone mode, we don't have separated render workers so if both app and pages are used, we need to resolve to the prebundled React to ensure the correctness of the version for app.

> Require these modules with static paths to make sure they are tracked by NFT when building the app in standalone mode, as we are now conditionally aliasing them it's tricky to track them in build time.

On every request, we try to detect whether the route is using the Pages Router or the App Router. If the Pages Router is being used, we set `__NEXT_PRIVATE_PREBUNDLED_REACT` to `undefined`, which means the React version from the `node_modules` is used. However, if the App Router is used, `__NEXT_PRIVATE_PREBUNDLED_REACT` is set, and the prebundled React version is used.

#### WORKAROUND: 13.4.13+ breaking changes (middleware, redirect, rewrites)

Nextjs 13.4.13 refactored the middleware logic so that it no longer runs in the server handler. Instead they are executed as workers in child threads, which introduces a non-acceptable latency of ~5 seconds. In order to circumvent this issue, open-next needs to implement the middleware handler before processing the server handler ourselves.

We've introduced a custom esbuild plugin to conditionally inject and override code to properly handle the breaking changes.

The default request handler is in `adapters/plugins/default.ts`
When open-next needs to override that implementation due to NextJs breaking compatibility, the `createServerBundle` in `build.ts` determines the proper overrides to replace the code of the `default.ts` file.
