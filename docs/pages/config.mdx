### Build Arguments

There is two build arguments that you can pass to the `open-next build` command:

- `--config-path` - This is the path to the configuration file that you want to use. By default, it will look for `open-next.config.ts` in the current working directory. This needs to be relative to the current working directory.
- `--node-externals` - You can configure externals for the esbuild compilation of the `open-next.config.ts` file (i.e `--node-externals @aws-sdk/*,open-next/dist/queue/*`)

### Configuration File

For personalisation you need to create a file `open-next.config.ts` at the same place as your `next.config.js`, and export a default object that satisfies the `OpenNextConfig` interface. It is possible to not have an `open-next.config.ts` file, the default configuration will then be applied automatically.

This file needs to be placed at the same level as your `next.config.js` file.

If you have an `open-next.config.ts` file, make sure you have atleast this:

```ts
export default {
  default: {},
};
```

If you want to take a look at some simple configuration examples, you can check the [simple example](/config/simple_example).

For more advanced use cases, you can check [how to implement custom overrides](/config/custom_overrides).
