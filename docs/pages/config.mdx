### Build Arguments

There is a single build argument that you can pass to the `open-next build` command: 
- `--config-path` - This is the path to the configuration file that you want to use. By default, it will look for `open-next.config.ts` in the current working directory. This needs to be relative to the current working directory.

### Configuration File

For personalisation you need to create a file `open-next.config.ts` at the same place as your `next.config.js`, and export a default object that satisfies the `OpenNextConfig` interface.

This file needs to be placed at the same level as your `next.config.js` file.

If you want to take a look at some simple configuration examples, you can check the [simple example](/config/simple_example).

For more advanced use cases, you can check [how to implement custom overrides](/config/custom_overrides).
