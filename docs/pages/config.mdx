### Build Arguments

There is a single build argument that you can pass to the `open-next build` command: 
- `--config-path` - This is the path to the configuration file that you want to use. By default, it will look for `open-next.config.ts` in the current working directory. This needs to be relative to the current working directory.

### Configuration File

For personalisation you need to create a file `open-next.config.ts` at the same place as your `next.config.js`, and export a default object that satisfies the `OpenNextConfig` interface.

Here is a detailed example of an `open-next.config.ts` file: 
This file need to be at the same place as your `next.config.js` file

`server` in here could refer to a lambda function, a docker container, a node server or whatever that can support running nodejs code. (Even cloudflare workers in the future)

For more information about the options here, take a look at the [components section](/components/overview).

```ts
import type { OpenNextConfig } from 'open-next/types/open-next'
const config = {
  default: { // This is the default server, similar to the server-function in open-next v2
    // You don't have to provide the below, by default it will generate an output 
    // for normal lambda as in open-next v2
    override: { 
      wrapper: "aws-lambda-streaming", // This is necessary to enable lambda streaming
      // You can override any part that is a `LazyLoadedOverride` this way
      queue: () => Promise.resolve({
        send: async (message) => {
          //Your custom code here
        }
      })
    },
    minify: true, // This will minify the output
  },
  // Below we define the functions that we want to deploy in a different server
  // This is only used if you want to split the server into multiple servers

        ], // For app dir, you need to include route|page, no need to include layout or loading
      patterns: ['api/*', 'route1', 'route2', 'route3'], // patterns needs to be in a cloudfront compatible format, this will be used to generate the output
      override: {
        wrapper: "aws-lambda-streaming",
      },
      // This enables the bundled next server which is faster and reduce the size of the server
      // This is also experimental and might not work in all cases
      experimentalBundledNextServer: true 
    },
    pageSsr: {
      routes: ["pages/pageSsr"], // For page dir routes should be in the form `pages/${route}` without the extension, it should match the filesystem

  // By setting this, it will create another bundle for the middleware, 
  // and the middleware will be deployed in a separate server. 
  // If not set middleware will be bundled inside the servers

  imageOptimization: {

  // If you want to override the default build command, you can do it here
  // By default it uses `npm run build`
  buildCommand: "echo 'hello world'",

  dangerous: {
    // This will disable the tag cache
    // You can use it safely on page router, on app router it will break revalidateTag and revalidatePath
    disableTagCache: true, 
    // This will disable the incremental cache
    // This is generally not recommended, as this is necessary for ISR AND SSG routes as well as the fetch cache
    disableIncrementalCache: true, 
  }

  //The path to the target folder of build output from the `buildCommand` option (the path which will contain the `.next` and `.open-next` folders). This path is relative from the current process.cwd() - Optional default to "."
  buildOutputPath: "build",
