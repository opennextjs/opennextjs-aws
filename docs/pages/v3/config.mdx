Here is a simple example of an `open-next.config.ts` file: 
This file need to be at the same place as your `next.config.js` file

`server` in here could refer to a lambda function, a docker container, a node server or whatever that can support running nodejs code. (Even cloudflare workers in the future)

For more information about the options here, just look at the source file

```ts
import type { BuildOptions } from 'open-next/types/open-next'
const config = {
  default: { // This is the default server, similar to the server-function in open-next v2
    // You don't have to provide the below, by default it will generate an output 
    // for normal lambda as in open-next v2
    override: { 
      wrapper: "aws-lambda-streaming", // This is necessary to enable lambda streaming
      // You can override any part that is a `LazyLoadedOverride` this way
      queue: () => Promise.resolve({
        send: async (message) => {
          //Your custom code here
        }
      })
    },
  },
  // Below we define the functions that we want to deploy in a different server
  functions: { 
    ssr: {
      routes: [
        "app/api/isr/route", "app/api/sse/route", "app/api/revalidateTag/route", // app dir Api routes
        "app/route1/page", "app/route2/page", // app dir pages
        "pages/route3" // page dir pages
        ], // For app dir, you need to include route|page, no need to include layout or loading
      patterns: ['api/*', 'route1', 'route2', 'route3'], // patterns needs to be in a cloudfront compatible format, this will be used to generate the output
      override: {
        wrapper: "aws-lambda-streaming",
      },
      experimentalBundledNextServer: true // This enables the bundled next server which is faster and reduce the size of the server
    },
    pageSsr: {
      routes: ["pages/pageSsr"], // For page dir routes should be in the form `pages/${route}` without the extension, it should match the filesystem
      patterns: [ 'pageSsr', "_next/data/BUILD_ID/pageSsr.json"],
      override: {
        wrapper: "node",
        converter: "node",
        // This is necessary to generate the dockerfile and for the implementation to know that it needs to deploy on docker
        generateDockerfile: true,
      },
    },
    edge: {
      runtime: "edge",
      routes: ["app/ssr/page"],
      patterns: ["ssr"],
      override: {}
    }    
  },
  // By setting this, it will create another bundle for the middleware, 
  // and the middleware will be deployed in a separate server. 
  // If not set middleware will be bundled inside the servers
  // It could be in lambda@edge, cloudflare workers, or anywhere else
  // By default it uses lambda@edge
  // This is not implemented in the reference construct implementation.
  middleware: {
    external: true 
  }
  buildCommand: "echo 'hello world'",
} satisfies BuildOptions
