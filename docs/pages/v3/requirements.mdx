There is a couple of requirements necessary for open-next V3 to work.
It will be divided by functionality. This is still WIP, feel free to open a PR if you think something is missing.

## General
- For the node runtime, you need at least Node 18.
- For the edge runtime, you can use both Node 18+ or cloudflare workers with `node_compat` flag enabled (Cloudflare workers support is experimental)
- Open-next doesn't work well on Windows. We recommend using WSL2 or a Linux VM.

## ISR/SSG
ISR/SSG has 2 types of cache, the Incremental Cache and the Tag Cache. To actually trigger the ISR revalidation, we use a Queue system. 

The tag cache is only used in app router.
### Incremental Cache
By default we use S3 as the incremental cache. You can override this in `open-next.config.ts`. For this to work you need to provide server functions with the following environment variables:
- CACHE_BUCKET_REGION
- CACHE_BUCKET_NAME
- CACHE_BUCKET_KEY_PREFIX

### Tag Cache
By default we use DynamoDb as the tag cache. For this to work you need to provide server functions with the following environment variables:
- CACHE_DYNAMO_TABLE
- CACHE_BUCKET_REGION

### Queue
By default we use SQS as the queue. fFr this to work you need to provide server functions with the following environment variables:
- REVALIDATION_QUEUE_REGION
- REVALIDATION_QUEUE_URL

## External Middleware
If you decide to use external middleware, you need to provide the following environment variables:
- OPEN_NEXT_ORIGIN

This env variable should contain a stringified version of this, with every key corresponding to the key used in functions inside `open-next.config.ts`: 
```ts
// For cloudflare workers
// THIS IS TEMPORARY, WE WILL CHANGE THIS TO USE THE SAME FORMAT AS NODE
{
  default: "example.com",
  ssr: "example2.com",
  ssg: "example3.com"
}
// Or for node
{
  default: {
    host: "example.com",
    protocol: "https",
    port: 443 // Optional
    customHeaders: {
      "x-custom-header": "value"
    } // Optional, headers that you'd want to pass to the origin
  },
  ...
}
```

## Image Optimization
For image optimization to work, you need to provide the following environment variables:
- BUCKET_NAME
- BUCKET_KEY_PREFIX
