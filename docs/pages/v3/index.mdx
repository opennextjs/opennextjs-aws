## What's new in V3?

- Rewritten server (We moved from the serverless-http `ServerResponse` into our own version which respect nodejs stream)
- A new `open-next.config.ts` file to configure your project
- Native support for aws lambda, aws lambda streaming, lambda@edge, node and docker
- In this `open-next.config.ts` you can now override a lot of things which allow for more customization:
  - Wrapper component
  - Converter component
  - Incremental Cache
  - Tag Cache
  - Queue
  - Custom warmer function
  - Custom revalidation function
  - Custom loader for image optimization
  - Custom initialization function

- Allow for splitting, you can now split your next app into multiple servers, which could each have their own configuration
- An experimental bundled `NextServer` could be used which can reduce the size of your lambda by up to 24 MB
- ~~Support for the `edge` runtime of next~~ (coming soon)
