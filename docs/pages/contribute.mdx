To run `OpenNext` locally:

1. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/sst/open-next).
2. Build `open-next`:
   ```bash
   cd open-next
   pnpm build
   ```
3. Run `open-next` in watch mode:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
4. Now, you can make changes in `open-next` and build your Next.js app to test the changes.
   ```bash
   cd path/to/my/nextjs/app
   path/to/open-next/packages/open-next/dist/index.js build
   ```

It can be a bit cumbersome to need to deploy every time you want to test changes. If your change is not dependent on the wrapper or the converter, then you can create a custom `open-next.config.ts` file, you can take a look [here](/contribute/local_run) for more information.
