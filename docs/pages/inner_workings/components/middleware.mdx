  When we talk about middleware in this docs, we are referring both to the next `middleware` as well as the whole `routing` layer of next.
  For example, `next.config.js` headers, redirects, rewrites, etc. are all considered `routing` in this context.

Since V3, you can decide to move the middleware outside of the server into it's own function that you can place in front of your others backend functions.

By default, the middleware is inside the server, but you can move it outside by setting `middleware.external` to `true` in your `open-next.config.ts` file.
```ts
{
  middleware: {
    external: true
  }
}
```
It uses the `aws-lambda` wrapper and the `aws-cloudfront` converter by default so that you can use it with AWS Lambda@edge and Cloudfront.
You can also use it inside Cloudflare Workers by setting the wrapper to `cloudflare` and the converter to `edge`.

### Special overrides

#### Origin resolver

Since your app could be split into different origins, you need to be able to retrieve the right origin for the request. That's the purpose of the `originResolver` function. 

By default, it uses the `pattern-env` resolver which uses an `OPEN_NEXT_ORIGIN` environment variable to resolve the origin as well as the pattern defined in your `open-next.config.ts`. This env var should be a stringified version of an object of this shape:
```ts
{
  // Key should be the same as the one used in `open-next.config.ts` for the functions
  [origin: string]: {
    host: string;
    protocol: "http" | "https";
    port?: number;
    customHeaders?: Record<string, string>;
  }
}
```
You can of course override this behavior by providing your own `originResolver` function in your `open-next.config.ts` file.
This is the type of the `originResolver` function:
```ts
type OriginResolver = BaseOverride & {
  resolve: (path: string) => Promise<Origin | false>;
};
```
