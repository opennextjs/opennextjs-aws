## Architecture overview

OpenNext does not create the underlying infrastructure. You can create the infrastructure for your app with your preferred tool — SST, AWS CDK, Terraform, Serverless Framework, etc.

This is the recommended setup.

We are going to take a look at every component created by OpenNext.

#### Asset files

OpenNext will create a `.open-next/assets` folder containing the hashed and un-hashed files. Those files can be directly served without going through the server function. Files in `.open-next/assets` should be served from the root of your website. For example, the file `.open-next/assets/favicon.ico` should be served from `/favicon.ico`.


There are two types of files in the `.open-next/assets` folder:

**Hashed files**

These are files with a hash component in the file name. Hashed files are be found in the `.open-next/assets/_next` folder, such as `.open-next/assets/_next/static/css/0275f6d90e7ad339.css`. The hash values in the filenames are guaranteed to change when the content of the files is modified. Therefore, hashed files should be cached both at the CDN level and at the browser level. The recommended cache control setting for these file is

```
public,max-age=31536000,immutable
```

**Un-hashed files**

Other files inside the `.open-next/assets` folder are copied from your app's `public/` folder, such as `.open-next/assets/favicon.ico`. The filename for un-hashed files may remain unchanged when the content is modified. Un-hashed files should be cached at the CDN level, but not at the browser level. When the content of un-hashed files is modified, the CDN cache should be invalidated on deploy. The recommended cache control setting for these file is

```
public,max-age=0,s-maxage=31536000,must-revalidate
```

#### Cache files

OpenNext will create a `.open-next/cache` folder containing cache data used by the incremental cache(i.e. ISR **and** SSG routes). These files should not be publicly accessible.

There are two types of caches in the `.open-next/cache` folder:

- Route cache: This cache includes `html` and `json` or `rsc` files that are prerendered during the build. They are merged into a single `.cache` file. They are used to seed the revalidation cache.
- Fetch cache: This cache includes fetch call responses, which might contain sensitive information. Make sure these files are not publicly accessible.

#### Image optimization backend

This backend handles image optimization requests when the Next.js `<Image>` component is used. The [sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) library, which is bundled with the function, is used to convert the image. The library is compiled against the selected architecture (by default `arm64`) and is intended to run on Node.

Note that the image optimization backend responds with the `Cache-Control` header, so the image will be cached both at the CDN level and at the browser level.

See [Image Optimization](/features/image-optimization) for more details.

#### Servers Lambda backend

These backends handles all other types of requests from the Next.js app, including Server-side Rendering (SSR) requests, Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) requests, Static Site Generation requests (SSG) and API requests. OpenNext builds the Next.js app in **standalone** mode. The standalone mode generates a `.next` folder containing the **NextServer** class that handles requests and a `node_modules` folder with **all the dependencies** needed to run the `NextServer`. The structure looks like this:

```
  .next/                -> NextServer
  node_modules/         -> dependencies
```

The server backend adapter wraps around `NextServer` and exports a handler function that supports the Lambda request and response. The `server-function` bundle looks like this:

```diff
  .next/                -> NextServer
+ .open-next/
  node_modules/         -> dependencies
+ index.mjs             -> server function adapter
```

**Monorepo**

In the case of a monorepo, the build output looks slightly different. For example, if the app is located in `packages/web`, the build output looks like this:

```
  packages/
    web/
      .next/            -> NextServer
      node_modules/     -> dependencies from root node_modules (optional)
  node_modules/         -> dependencies from package node_modules
```

In this case, the server function adapter needs to be created inside `packages/web` next to `.next/`. This is to ensure that the adapter can import dependencies from both `node_modules` folders. It is not a good practice to have the Lambda configuration coupled with the project structure, so instead of setting the Lambda handler to `packages/web/index.mjs`, we will add a wrapper `index.mjs` at the `server-function` bundle root that re-exports the adapter. The resulting structure looks like this:

```diff
  packages/
    web/
      .next/                -> NextServer
+     .open-next/
      node_modules/          -> dependencies from root node_modules (optional)
+     index.mjs              -> server function adapter
  node_modules/              -> dependencies from package node_modules
+ index.mjs                  -> adapter wrapper
```

This ensures that the function handler remains at `index.mjs`.

#### Revalidation backend

OpenNext will create a `.open-next/revalidation-function` folder containing the revalidation backend.

This backend is supposed to handle revalidation requests from the revalidation queue. The revalidation queue is a FIFO queue that contains messages for revalidating routes. The revalidation backend polls the queue for messages and sends a HEAD request to the specified route for revalidation.

#### Warmer backend

OpenNext will create a `.open-next/warmer-function` folder containing the warmer backend.

#### Tag Provider backend

This is used to populate the revalidation table with tags.
