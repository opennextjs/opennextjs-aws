  Streaming support is **EXTREMELY EXPERIMENTAL**... AWS has updated their runtime in the past which broke streaming... It seems stable now but if they do another rugpull, it could cause your app to break.

  **It's not recommended to use streaming in production.**

Streaming is using the new AWS lambda support for [streaming responses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-response-streaming.html). This allows you to send data to the client as it's generated instead of waiting for the entire response to be generated.

If you want to try streaming you need to set the function url invoke mode to `RESPONSE_STREAM`.
You'll also need to add a `--streaming` tags to the build cli.
  
```bash
open-next build --streaming
```
