When calling `open-next build`, OpenNext **runs `next build`** to build the Next.js app, and then **transforms the build output** to a format that can be deployed to AWS.

#### Building the Next.js app

OpenNext runs the `build` script in your `package.json` file. Depending on the lock file found in the app, the corresponding packager manager will be used. Either `npm run build`, `yarn build`, or `pnpm build` will be run. For more on customizing the build command, see [overriding the build command](/advanced/options#custom-build-command).

#### Transforming the build output

The build output is then transformed into a format that can be deployed to AWS. The transformed output is generated inside the `.open-next` folder within your Next.js app. Files in `assets/` are ready to be uploaded to AWS S3. And the function code is wrapped inside Lambda handlers, ready to be deployed to AWS Lambda or Lambda@Edge.

```bash
my-next-app/
  .open-next/
    cache/                         -> ISR cache files to upload - This cannot be directly served
    assets/                        -> Static files to upload
    server-functions/
      default/                     -> Handler code for the default server
      other-fn/                    -> Handler code for another backend
    revalidation-function/         -> Handler code for revalidation backend
    image-optimization-function/   -> Handler code for image optimization backend
    warmer-function/               -> Cron job code to keep server function warm - Not mandatory
    dynamo-provider/               -> Code for a custom resource to populate the Tag Cache - Only necessary for app dir
