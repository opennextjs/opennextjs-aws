OpenNext allows you to deploy your Next.js apps using a growing list of frameworks.

### SST

The easiest way to deploy OpenNext to AWS is with [SST](https://docs.sst.dev/start/nextjs). This is maintained by the OpenNext team and only requires three simple steps:

1. Run `npx create-sst@latest` in your Next.js app
2. Run `npm install`
3. Deploy to AWS `npx sst deploy`

For more information, check out the SST docs: https://docs.sst.dev/start/nextjs

### Ion

You can also deploy OpenNext to AWS using [Ion](https://ion.sst.dev/). 

Check out the [Ion Docs](https://ion.sst.dev/docs/component/aws/nextjs/)
