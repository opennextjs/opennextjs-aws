If your Next.js app is already deployed to another platform or using another open-source framework, you'd want to take a look here:

#### Vercel

Everything should already be set up for you. But there are a few things you should know:

- Streaming by default is disabled in open-next (for now). It is very **experimental** right now see [here](/inner_workings/streaming) for more info.
- Middleware is not run for static file and for image requests with open-next.

#### AWS Amplify

#### Netlify

#### serverless-nextjs

You should remove some stuff from your `next.config.js` file, otherwise you'll get a build error.:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  target: 'serverless', // remove this
  // ...
}
```
