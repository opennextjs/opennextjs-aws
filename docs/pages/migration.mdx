If your Next.js app is already deployed to another platform or using another open-source framework, you'd want to take a look here:

#### From OpenNext V2

If you used all the default configurations, you should be able to deploy your app without any changes.

OpenNext V3 replaced all the build args with a [custom config file](/config#configuration-file).

Here are the old build args and their new equivalent:

- `--build-command` : `buildCommand` inside the config file.
- `--app-path`: `appPath` inside the config file.
- `--build-output-path`: `buildOutputPath` inside the config file.
- `--package-json-path`: `packageJsonPath` inside the config file.
- `--minify`: `minify` options inside each function property. This is enabled on a per function basis now.
- `--streaming`: This is dependent on the wrapper you're using on a per function basis. To enable streaming in aws lambda, you can set `wrapper: 'aws-lambda-streaming'` in the override property of the function. Please note that AWS lambda streaming still suffer from buffering issue from the runtime itself. See [here](/inner_workings/components/overview#aws-lambda-streaming) for more info.
- `--dangerously-disable-dynamodb-cache`: `dangerous.disableTagCache` inside the config file.
- `--dangerously-disable-incremental-cache`: `dangerous.disableIncrementalCache` inside the config file.

#### Vercel

Everything should already be set up for you. But there are a few things you should know:

- Streaming by default is disabled in open-next (for now). It is very **experimental** right now see [here](/inner_workings/streaming) for more info.
- Middleware is not run for static file and for image requests with open-next.

#### serverless-nextjs

You should remove some stuff from your `next.config.js` file, otherwise you'll get a build error.:

```js
module.exports = {
  // ...
  target: 'serverless', // remove this
  // ...
}
```
