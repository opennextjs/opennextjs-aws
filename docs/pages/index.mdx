### Open source Next.js adapter

---


OpenNext takes the Next.js build output and converts it into packages that can be deployed  across a variety of environments. 
Natively OpenNext has support for AWS Lambda and classic Node Server. It also offer partial support for the `edge` runtime in Cloudflare Workers.

One notable feature of OpenNext is its ability to split the Next.js output, enabling selective deployment to different targets such as AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers, or Amazon ECS. This facilitates a tailored deployment strategy that aligns with the specific needs of your application.

Thanks to this, you could deploy part of your API to ECS, another part to Cloudflare Workers, your SSR routes to another ECS cluster, and your ISR/SSG routes to Lambda.

While Vercel is great, it's not a good option if all your infrastructure is on AWS. Hosting it in your AWS account makes it easy to integrate with your backend. And it's a lot cheaper than Vercel.

Vercel is also limited to serverless and to their way of doing things. OpenNext is open source and can be deployed to any platform that supports Node.js.

Next.js, unlike Remix or Astro, doesn't have a way to self-host using **serverless**. You can run it as a Node application. This however doesn't work the same way as it does on Vercel.

---

There have been several attempts to fix this. Broadly falling into two categories; open source framework specific implementations, or closed source SaaS products.

Most of the open source options, like [serverless-nextjs](https://github.com/serverless-nextjs/serverless-next.js) are dead. Their implementation can also be specific to the framework they are targeting.

Closed source SaaS products like [Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) have incomplete or incorrect implementations. And because they are closed source, you'll need to file a support ticket to get them updated.
