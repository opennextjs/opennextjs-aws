### Open source Next.js serverless adapter

---

OpenNext takes the Next.js build output and converts it into a package that can be deployed to any functions as a service platform. As of now only AWS Lambda is supported.

While Vercel is great, it's not a good option if all your infrastructure is on AWS. Hosting it in your AWS account makes it easy to integrate with your backend. And it's a lot cheaper than Vercel.

Next.js, unlike Remix or Astro, doesn't have a way to self-host using serverless. You can run it as a Node application. This however doesn't work the same way as it does on Vercel.

---

There have been several attempts to fix this. Broadly falling into two categories; open source framework specific implementations, or closed source SaaS products.

Most of the open source options, like [serverless-nextjs](https://github.com/serverless-nextjs/serverless-next.js) are dead. Their implementation can also be specific to the framework they are targeting.

Closed source SaaS products like [Amplify](https://aws.amazon.com/amplify/) have incomplete or incorrect implementations. And because they are closed source, you'll need to file a support ticket to get them updated.

---

The goal of OpenNext is to create an open source, framework agnostic, serverless adapter for Next.js.

OpenNext is currently built for AWS but we plan to support any functions as a service platform.

We need your help keeping it up to date and feature complete. Make sure to [**join us on Discord**](https://sst.dev/discord) and [**star us on GitHub**](https://github.com/sst/open-next).
