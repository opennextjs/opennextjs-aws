Here is a detailed example of an `open-next.config.ts` file: 
This file need to be at the same place as your `next.config.js` file

`server` in here could refer to a lambda function, a docker container, a node server or whatever that can support running nodejs code. (Even cloudflare workers in the future)

For more information about the options here, take a look at the [components section](/components/overview).

```ts

  default: { // This is the default server, similar to the server-function in open-next v2
    // You don't have to provide the below, by default it will generate an output 
    // for normal lambda as in open-next v2
    override: { 
      wrapper: "aws-lambda-streaming", // This is necessary to enable lambda streaming
      // You can override any part that is a `LazyLoadedOverride` this way
      queue: () => Promise.resolve({
        send: async (message) => {
          //Your custom code here
        }
      })
    },
    minify: true, // This will minify the output
  },

  // This is only used if you want to split the server into multiple servers

      patterns: ['api/*', 'route1', 'route2', 'route3'], // patterns needs to be in a cloudfront compatible format, this will be used to generate the output
      override: {
        wrapper: "aws-lambda-streaming",

    pageSsr: {
      routes: ["pages/pageSsr"], // For page dir routes should be in the form `pages/${route}` without the extension, it should match the filesystem

  // By setting this, it will create another bundle for the middleware, 
  // and the middleware will be deployed in a separate server.

  buildCommand: "echo 'hello world'",

  dangerous: {

    // You can use it safely on page router, on app router it will break revalidateTag and revalidatePath
    disableTagCache: true, 
    // This will disable the incremental cache
    // This is generally not recommended, as this is necessary for ISR AND SSG routes as well as the fetch cache
    disableIncrementalCache: true,

  //The path to the target folder of build output from the `buildCommand` option (the path which will contain the `.next` and `.open-next` folders). This path is relative from the current process.cwd() - Optional default to "."
