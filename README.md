## Description

OpenNext takes the Next.js build output and converts it into packages that can be deployed across a variety of environments. Natively OpenNext has support for AWS Lambda, and classic Node.js Server.

## Features

OpenNext aims to support all Next.js 14 features. Some features are work in progress. If you are running into any problems make sure to check the [docs](https://opennext.js.org/aws) first before you open a [new issue](/issues/new) or visit our [Discord](https://discord.gg/opennextjs) to let us know!

## Who is using OpenNext?

[Gymshark UK](https://uk.gymshark.com), [Udacity](https://engineering.udacity.com/deploying-next-js-on-the-edge-with-sst-is-sst-the-game-changer-its-claimed-to-be-1f05a0abc27c), [TUDN](https://www.tudn.com), [NHS England](https://github.com/nhs-england-tools/terraform-aws-opennext)

## Configuration

### Configuration file

For personalisation you need to create a file `open-next.config.ts` at the same place as your `next.config.js`, and export a default object that satisfies the `OpenNextConfig` interface. It is possible to not have an open-next.config.ts file, the default configuration will then be applied automatically.

### Debug mode

OpenNext can be executed in debug mode by setting the environment variable `OPEN_NEXT_DEBUG=true` before your build.

This will output A LOT of additional logs to the console. This also disable minifying in esbuild, and add source maps to the output. This can result in code that might be up to 2-3X larger than the production build. Do **not** enable this in production.

You can read more about the configuration in the [docs](https://opennext.js.org/aws/config)


## Contribute

To run `OpenNext` locally:

1. Clone this repository.
1. Build `open-next`:
   ```bash
   cd packages/open-next
   pnpm build
   ```
1. Run `open-next` in watch mode:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
1. Now, you can make changes in `open-next` and build your Next.js app to test the changes.
   ```bash
   cd path/to/my/nextjs/app
   path/to/open-next/packages/open-next/dist/index.js build
   ```

### Coldstart

OpenNext provide you with a warmer function that can be used to reduce cold start.

On Lambda, there are multiple scenarios where a lambda will trigger a cold start even if you have some warmed instance. For example if you have more requests than warm instances you'll get a cold start. Also NextJs lazy load the routes, so even if you hit a warm instance, this specific route might not have been loaded yet.

## Acknowledgements

We are grateful for the projects that inspired OpenNext and the amazing tools and libraries developed by the community:

- [nextjs-lambda](https://github.com/sladg/nextjs-lambda) by [Jan](https://github.com/sladg) for serving as inspiration for packaging Next.js's standalone output to Lambda.
- [CDK NextJS](https://github.com/jetbridge/cdk-nextjs/) by [JetBridge](https://github.com/jetbridge) for its contribution to the deployment architecture of a Next.js application on AWS.
- [serverless-http](https://github.com/dougmoscrop/serverless-http) by [Doug Moscrop](https://github.com/dougmoscrop) for developing an excellent library for transforming AWS Lambda events and responses.
- [serverless-nextjs](https://github.com/serverless-nextjs/serverless-next.js) by [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless) for paving the way for serverless Next.js applications on AWS.

Special shoutout to [@khuezy](https://github.com/khuezy) and [@conico974](https://github.com/conico974) for their outstanding contributions to the project.
