OpenNext takes the Next.js build output and converts it into a package that can be deployed to any functions as a service platform.

## Features

OpenNext aims to support all Next.js 13 features. Some features are work in progress. Please open a [new issue](/issues/new) to let us know!

- [x] API routes
- [x] Dynamic routes
- [x] Static site generation (SSG)
- [x] Server-side rendering (SSR)
- [x] Incremental static regeneration (ISR)
- [x] Middleware
- [x] Image optimization
- [x] [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org)
- [x] [Running at edge](#running-at-edge)
- [x] [No cold start](#warmer-function)

## How does OpenNext work?

When calling `open-next build`, OpenNext **runs `next build`** to build the Next.js app, and then **transforms the build output** to a format that can be deployed to AWS.

#### Building the Next.js app

OpenNext runs the `build` script in your `package.json` file. Depending on the lock file found in the app, the corresponding packager manager will be used. Either `npm run build`, `yarn build`, or `pnpm build` will be run.

#### Transforming the build output

The build output is then transformed into a format that can be deployed to AWS. The transformed output is generated inside the `.open-next` folder within your Next.js app. Files in `assets/` are ready to be uploaded to AWS S3. And the function code is wrapped inside Lambda handlers, ready to be deployed to AWS Lambda or Lambda@Edge.

```bash
my-next-app/
  .open-next/
    assets/                        -> Static files to upload to an S3 Bucket
    server-function/               -> Handler code for server Lambda Function
    image-optimization-function/   -> Handler code for image optimization Lambda Function
    warmer-function/               -> Cron job code to keep server function warm
```

## Deployment

OpenNext allows you to deploy your Next.js apps using a growing list of frameworks.

### SST

The easiest way to deploy OpenNext to AWS is with [SST](https://docs.sst.dev/start/nextjs). This is maintained by the OpenNext team and only requires three simple steps:

1. Run `npx create-sst@latest` in your Next.js app
2. Run `npm install`
3. Deploy to AWS `npx sst deploy`

For more information, check out the SST docs: https://docs.sst.dev/start/nextjs

### Other Frameworks

The OpenNext community has contributed deployment options for a few other frameworks.

- CDK: https://github.com/jetbridge/cdk-nextjs
- CloudFormation: https://github.com/serverless-stack/open-next/issues/32
- Serverless Framework: https://github.com/serverless-stack/open-next/issues/32

To use these, you'll need to run the following inside your Next.js app.

```bash
$ npx open-next@latest build
```

If you are using OpenNext to deploy using a framework that is not listed here, please let us know so we can add it to the list.

## Recommended infrastructure on AWS

OpenNext does not create the underlying infrastructure. You can create the infrastructure for your app with your preferred tool â€” SST, AWS CDK, Terraform, Serverless Framework, etc.

This is the recommended setup.

<p align="center">
  <img alt="Architecture" src="docs/public/architecture.png" width="800" />
</p>

Here are the recommended configurations for each AWS resource.

#### S3 bucket

Create an S3 bucket and upload the content in the `.open-next/assets` folder to the root of the bucket. For example, the file `.open-next/assets/favicon.ico` should be uploaded to `/favicon.ico` at the root of the bucket.

There are two types of files in the `.open-next/assets` folder:

**Hashed files**

These are files with a hash component in the file name. Hashed files are be found in the `.open-next/assets/_next` folder, such as `.open-next/assets/_next/static/css/0275f6d90e7ad339.css`. The hash values in the filenames are guaranteed to change when the content of the files is modified. Therefore, hashed files should be cached both at the CDN level and at the browser level. When uploading the hashed files to S3, the recommended cache control setting is

```
public,max-age=31536000,immutable
```

**Un-hashed files**

Other files inside the `.open-next/assets` folder are copied from your app's `public/` folder, such as `.open-next/assets/favicon.ico`. The filename for un-hashed files may remain unchanged when the content is modified. Un-hashed files should be cached at the CDN level, but not at the browser level. When the content of un-hashed files is modified, the CDN cache should be invalidated on deploy. When uploading the un-hashed files to S3, the recommended cache control setting is

```
public,max-age=0,s-maxage=31536000,must-revalidate
```

#### Image optimization function

Create a Lambda function using the code in the `.open-next/image-optimization-function` folder, with the handler `index.mjs`. Also, ensure that the function is configured as follows:

- Set the architecture to `arm64`.
- Set the `BUCKET_NAME` environment variable with the value being the name of the S3 bucket where the original images are stored.
- Grant `s3:GetObject` permission.

This function handles image optimization requests when the Next.js `<Image>` component is used. The [sharp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sharp) library, which is bundled with the function, is used to convert the image. The library is compiled against the `arm64` architecture and is intended to run on AWS Lambda Arm/Graviton2 architecture. [Learn about the better cost-performance offered by AWS Graviton2 processors.](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/aws-lambda-functions-powered-by-aws-graviton2-processor-run-your-functions-on-arm-and-get-up-to-34-better-price-performance/)

Note that the image optimization function responds with the `Cache-Control` header, so the image will be cached both at the CDN level and at the browser level.

#### Server Lambda function

Create a Lambda function using the code in the `.open-next/server-function` folder, with the handler `index.mjs`.

This function handles all other types of requests from the Next.js app, including Server-side Rendering (SSR) requests and API requests. OpenNext builds the Next.js app in **standalone** mode. The standalone mode generates a `.next` folder containing the **NextServer** class that handles requests and a `node_modules` folder with **all the dependencies** needed to run the `NextServer`. The structure looks like this:

```
  .next/                -> NextServer
  node_modules/         -> dependencies
```

The server function adapter wraps around `NextServer` and exports a handler function that supports the Lambda request and response. The `server-function` bundle looks like this:

```diff
  .next/                -> NextServer
+ .open-next/
+   public-files.json   -> `/public` file listing
  node_modules/         -> dependencies
+ index.mjs             -> server function adapter
```

The file `public-files.json` contains the top-level file and directory names in your app's `public/` folder. At runtime, the server function will forward any requests made to these files and directories to S3. And S3 will serve them directly. [See why.](#workaround-public-static-files-served-out-by-server-function-aws-specific)

**Monorepo**

In the case of a monorepo, the build output looks slightly different. For example, if the app is located in `packages/web`, the build output looks like this:

```
  packages/
    web/
      .next/            -> NextServer
      node_modules/     -> dependencies from root node_modules (optional)
  node_modules/         -> dependencies from package node_modules
```

In this case, the server function adapter needs to be created inside `packages/web` next to `.next/`. This is to ensure that the adapter can import dependencies from both `node_modules` folders. It is not a good practice to have the Lambda configuration coupled with the project structure, so instead of setting the Lambda handler to `packages/web/index.mjs`, we will add a wrapper `index.mjs` at the `server-function` bundle root that re-exports the adapter. The resulting structure looks like this:

```diff
  packages/
    web/
      .next/                -> NextServer
+     .open-next/
+       public-files.json   -> `/public` file listing
      node_modules/          -> dependencies from root node_modules (optional)
+     index.mjs              -> server function adapter
  node_modules/              -> dependencies from package node_modules
+ index.mjs                  -> adapter wrapper
```

This ensures that the Lambda handler remains at `index.mjs`.

#### CloudFront distribution

Create a CloudFront distribution, and dispatch requests to their corresponding handlers (behaviors). The following behaviors are configured:

| Behavior          | Requests            | CloudFront Function                                                                         | Origin                                                                                                                                       |

#### Running at edge

The server function can also run at edge locations by configuring it as Lambda@Edge on Origin Request. The server function can accept both regional request events (API payload version 2.0) and edge request events (CloudFront Origin Request payload). Depending on the shape of the Lambda event object, the function will process the request accordingly.

To configure the CloudFront distribution:

| Behavior          | Requests            | CloudFront Function                                                                         | Lambda@Edge     | Origin                                                                                               |

#### Warmer function

Server functions may experience performance issues due to Lambda cold starts. To mitigate this, the server function can be invoked periodically. Remember, **Warming is optional** and is only required if you want to keep the server function warm.

To set this up, create a Lambda function using the code in the `.open-next/warmer-function` folder with `index.mjs` as the handler. Ensure the function is configured as follows:

- Set the `FUNCTION_NAME` environment variable with the value being the name of the server Lambda function.
- Set the `CONCURRENCY` environment variable with the value being the number of server functions to warm.
- Grant `lambda:InvokeFunction` permission to allow the warmer to invoke the server function.

Also, create an EventBridge scheduled rule to invoke the warmer function every 5 minutes.

Please note, warming is currently only supported when the server function is deployed to a single region (Lambda).

**Prewarm**

Each time you deploy, a new version of the Lambda function will be generated. All warmed server function instances will be turned off. And there won't be any warm instances until the warmer function runs again at the next 5-minute interval.

To ensure the functions are prewarmed on deploy, create a [CloudFormation Custom Resource](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-custom-resources.html) to invoke the warmer function on deployment. The custom resource should be configured as follows:

- Invoke the warmer function on resource `Create` and `Update`.
- Include a timestamp value in the resource property to ensure the custom resource runs on every deployment.
- Grant `lambda:InvokeFunction` permission to allow the custom resource to invoke the warmer function.

**Cost**

There are three components to the cost:

1. EventBridge scheduler: $0.00864
   ```
   Requests cost â€” 8,640 invocations per month x $1/million = $0.00864
   ```
1. Warmer function: $0.145728288
   ```
   Requests cost â€” 8,640 invocations per month x $0.2/million = $0.001728
   Duration cost â€” 8,640 invocations per month x 1GB memory x 1s duration x $0.0000166667/GB-second = $0.144000288
   ```
1. Server function: $0.0161280288 per warmed instance
   ```
   Requests cost â€” 8,640 invocations per month x $0.2/million = $0.001728
   Duration cost â€” 8,640 invocations per month x 1GB memory x 100ms duration x $0.0000166667/GB-second = $0.0144000288
   ```

For example, keeping 50 instances of the server function warm will cost approximately **$0.96 per month**

```
$0.00864 + $0.145728288 + $0.0161280288 x 50 = $0.960769728
```

This cost estimate is based on the `us-east-1` region pricing and does not consider any free tier benefits.

## Limitations and workarounds

#### WORKAROUND: `public/` static files served by the server function (AWS specific)

As mentioned in the [S3 bucket](#s3-bucket) section, files in your app's `public/` folder are static and are uploaded to the S3 bucket. Ideally, requests for these files should be handled by the S3 bucket, like so:

```
https://my-nextjs-app.com/favicon.ico
```

This requires the CloudFront distribution to have the behavior `/favicon.ico` and set the S3 bucket as the origin. However, CloudFront has a [default limit of 25 behaviors per distribution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/cloudfront-limits.html#limits-web-distributions), so it is not a scalable solution to create one behavior per file.

To work around the issue, requests for `public/` files are handled by the catch all behavior `/*`. This behavior sends the request to the server function first, and if the server fails to handle the request, it will fall back to the S3 bucket.

During the build process, the top-level file and directory names in the `public/` folder are saved to the `.open-next/public-files.json` file within the server function bundle. At runtime, the server function checks the request URL path against the file. If the request is made to a file in the `public/` folder:

- When deployed to a single region (Lambda), the server function returns a 503 response right away, and S3, which is configured as the failover origin on 503 status code, will serve the file. [Refer to the CloudFront setup.](#cloudfront-distribution)
- When deployed to the edge (Lambda@Edge), the server function returns the request object. And the request will be handled by S3, which is configured as the origin. [Refer to the CloudFront setup.](#running-at-edge)

This means that on cache miss, the request may take slightly longer to process.

#### WORKAROUND: Set `x-forwarded-host` header (AWS specific)

When the server function receives a request, the `host` value in the Lambda request header is set to the hostname of the AWS Lambda service instead of the actual frontend hostname. This creates an issue for the server function (middleware, SSR routes, or API routes) when it needs to know the frontend host.

To work around the issue, a CloudFront function is run on Viewer Request, which sets the frontend hostname as the `x-forwarded-host` header. The function code looks like this:

```ts
function handler(event) {
  var request = event.request;
  request.headers["x-forwarded-host"] = request.headers.host;
  return request;
}
```

The server function would then sets the `host` header of the request to the value of the `x-forwarded-host` header when sending the request to the `NextServer`.

#### WORKAROUND: Set `NextRequest` geolocation data

When your application is hosted on Vercel, you can access a user's geolocation inside your middleware through the `NextRequest` object.

```ts
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  request.geo.country;
  request.geo.city;
}
```

When your application is hosted on AWS, you can [obtain the geolocation data from CloudFront request headers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/adding-cloudfront-headers.html#cloudfront-headers-viewer-location). However, there is no way to set this data on the `NextRequest` object passed to the middleware function.

To work around the issue, the `NextRequest` constructor is modified to initialize geolocation data from CloudFront headers, instead of using the default empty object.

```diff
- geo: init.geo || {}
+ geo: init.geo || {
+   country: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-country"),
+   countryName: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-country-name"),
+   region: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-country-region"),
+   regionName: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-country-region-name"),
+   city: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-city"),
+   postalCode: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-postal-code"),
+   timeZone: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-time-zone"),
+   latitude: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-latitude"),
+   longitude: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-longitude"),
+   metroCode: this.headers("cloudfront-viewer-metro-code"),
+ }
```

CloudFront provides more detailed geolocation information, such as postal code and timezone. Here is a complete list of `geo` properties available in your middleware:

```ts
export function middleware(request: NextRequest) {
  // Supported by Next.js
  request.geo.country;
  request.geo.region;
  request.geo.city;
  request.geo.latitude;
  request.geo.longitude;

  // Also supported by OpenNext
  request.geo.countryName;
  request.geo.regionName;
  request.geo.postalCode;
  request.geo.timeZone;
  request.geo.metroCode;
}
```

#### WORKAROUND: `NextServer` does not set cache response headers for HTML pages

As mentioned in the [Server function](#server-lambda-function) section, the server function uses the `NextServer` class from Next.js' build output to handle requests. However, `NextServer` does not seem to set the correct `Cache Control` headers.

To work around the issue, the server function checks if the request is for an HTML page, and sets the `Cache Control` header to:

```
public, max-age=0, s-maxage=31536000, must-revalidate
```

#### WORKAROUND: Set `NextServer` working directory (AWS specific)

Next.js recommends using `process.cwd()` instead of `__dirname` to get the app directory. For example, consider a `posts` folder in your app with markdown files:

```
pages/
posts/
  my-post.md
public/
next.config.js
package.json
```

You can build the file path like this:

```ts
path.join(process.cwd(), "posts", "my-post.md");
```

As mentioned in the [Server function](#server-lambda-function) section, in a non-monorepo setup, the `server-function` bundle looks like:

```
.next/
node_modules/
posts/
  my-post.md    <- path is "posts/my-post.md"
index.mjs
```

In this case, `path.join(process.cwd(), "posts", "my-post.md")` resolves to the correct path.

However, when the user's app is inside a monorepo (ie. at `/packages/web`), the `server-function` bundle looks like:

```
packages/
  web/
    .next/
    node_modules/
    posts/
      my-post.md    <- path is "packages/web/posts/my-post.md"
    index.mjs
node_modules/
index.mjs
```

In this case, `path.join(process.cwd(), "posts", "my-post.md")` cannot be resolved.

To work around the issue, we change the working directory for the server function to where `.next/` is located, ie. `packages/web`.

#### WORKAROUND: Set `__NEXT_PRIVATE_PREBUNDLED_REACT` to use prebundled React

For Next.js 13.2 and later versions, you need to explicitly set the `__NEXT_PRIVATE_PREBUNDLED_REACT` environment variable. Although this environment variable isn't documented at the time of writing, you can refer to the Next.js source code to understand its usage:

> In standalone mode, we don't have separated render workers so if both app and pages are used, we need to resolve to the prebundled React to ensure the correctness of the version for app.

> Require these modules with static paths to make sure they are tracked by NFT when building the app in standalone mode, as we are now conditionally aliasing them it's tricky to track them in build time.

On every request, we try to detect whether the route is using the Pages Router or the App Router. If the Pages Router is being used, we set `__NEXT_PRIVATE_PREBUNDLED_REACT` to `undefined`, which means the React version from the `node_modules` is used. However, if the App Router is used, `__NEXT_PRIVATE_PREBUNDLED_REACT` is set, and the prebundled React version is used.

## Example

In the `example` folder, you can find a Next.js benchmark app. It contains a variety of pages that each test a single Next.js feature. The app is deployed to both Vercel and AWS using [SST](https://docs.sst.dev/start/nextjs).

## Advanced usage

#### OPEN_NEXT_MINIFY

Enabling this option will minimize all `.js` and `.json` files in the server function bundle using the [node-minify](https://github.com/srod/node-minify) library. This can reduce the size of the server function bundle by about 40%, depending on the size of your app. To enable it, simply run:

```bash
OPEN_NEXT_MINIFY=true open-next build
```

Enabling this option can significantly help to reduce the cold start time of the server function. However, it's an **experimental feature**, and you need to opt-in to use it. Once this option is thoroughly tested and found to be stable, it will be enabled by default.

## Debugging

#### Function logs

To find the **server, image optimization, and warmer log**, go to the AWS CloudWatch console in the **region you deployed to**.

If the server function is **deployed to Lambda@Edge**, the logs will appear in the **region you are physically close to**. For example, if you deployed your app to `us-east-1` and you are visiting the app from in London, the logs are likely to be in `eu-west-2`.

#### Warmer function logs

The logs from the warmer function provide insights into the results of the warming process.

```
{ event: 'warmer result', sent: 2, success: 2, uniqueServersWarmed: 2 }
```

- `sent` â€” The number of times the warmer invoked the server function using the Lambda SDK. This value should correspond to the `CONCURRENCY` set in the warmer function.
- `success` â€” The number of SDK calls that returned a 200 status code, indicating successful invocations.
- `uniqueServersWarmed` â€” This helps track any instances that responded unusually quickly and served multiple warming requests. As all SDK calls are made concurrently using `await Promise.all()`, this metric is useful for monitoring the number of unique warmed instances.

#### Debug mode

You can run OpenNext in debug mode by setting the `OPEN_NEXT_DEBUG` environment variable:

```bash
OPEN_NEXT_DEBUG=true npx open-next@latest build
```

This does a few things:

1. Lambda handler functions in the build output will not be minified.
1. Lambda handler functions in the build output has sourcemap enabled inline.
1. Lambda handler functions will automatically `console.log` the request event object along with other debugging information.

It is recommended to **turn off debug mode when building for production** because:

1. Un-minified function code is 2-3X larger than minified code. This will result in longer Lambda cold start times.
1. Logging the event object on each request can result in a lot of logs being written to AWS CloudWatch. This will result in increased AWS costs.

#### Opening an issue

To help diagnose issues, it's always helpful to provide a reproducible setup when opening an issue. One easy way to do this is to create a pull request (PR) and add a new page to the [benchmark app](#example) located in the `example` folder, which reproduces the issue. The PR will automatically deploy the app to AWS.

## Contribute

To run `OpenNext` locally:

1. Clone this repository.
1. Build `open-next`:
   ```bash
   cd open-next
   pnpm build
   ```
1. Run `open-next` in watch mode:
   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```
1. Now, you can make changes in `open-next` and build your Next.js app to test the changes.
   ```bash
   cd path/to/my/nextjs/app
   path/to/open-next/packages/open-next/dist/index.js build
   ```

## FAQ

#### Will my Next.js app behave the same as it does on Vercel?

OpenNext aims to deploy your Next.js app to AWS using services like CloudFront, S3, and Lambda. While Vercel uses some AWS services, it also has proprietary infrastructures, resulting in a natural gap of feature parity. And OpenNext is filling that gap.

One architectural difference is how [middleware](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/middleware) is run, but this should not affect the behavior of most apps.

On Vercel, the Next.js app is built in an undocumented way using the "[minimalMode](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/29801)". The middleware code is separated from the server code and deployed to edge locations, while the server code is deployed to a single region. When a user makes a request, the middleware code runs first. Then the request reaches the CDN. If the request is cached, the cached response is returned; otherwise, the request hits the server function. This means that the middleware is called even for cached requests.

On the other hand, OpenNext uses the standard `next build` command, which generates a server function that includes the middleware code. This means that for cached requests, the CDN (CloudFront) will send back the cached response, and the middleware code is not run.

We previously built the app using the "minimalMode" and having the same architecture as Vercel, where the middleware code would run in Lambda@Edge on Viewer Request. See the [`vercel-mode` branch](https://github.com/serverless-stack/open-next/tree/vercel-mode). However, we decided that this architecture was not a good fit on AWS for a few reasons:

1. Cold start - Running middleware and server in two separate Lambda functions results in double the latency.
1. Maintenance - Because the "minimalMode" is not documented, there will likely be unhandled edge cases, and triaging would require constant reverse engineering of Vercel's code base.
1. Feature parity - Lambda@Edge functions triggered on Viewer Request do not have access to geolocation headers, which affects i18n support.

#### How does OpenNext compared to AWS Amplify?

OpenNext is an open source initiative, and there are a couple of advantages when compared to Amplify:

1. The community contributions to OpenNext allows it to have better feature support.

1. Amplify's Next.js hosting is a black box. Resources are not deployed to your AWS account. All Amplify users share the same CloudFront CDN owned by the Amplify team. This prevents you from customizing the setup, and customization is important if you are looking for Vercel-like features.

1. Amplify's implementation is closed-source. Bug fixes often take much longer to get fixed as you have to go through AWS support. And you are likely to encounter more quirks when hosting Next.js anywhere but Vercel.
