/* GRelation
 *
 * Indexed Relations.  Imagine a really simple table in a
 * database.  Relations are not ordered.  This data type is meant for
 * maintaining a N-way mapping.
 *
 * g_relation_new() creates a relation with FIELDS fields
 *
 * g_relation_destroy() frees all resources
 * g_tuples_destroy() frees the result of g_relation_select()
 *
 * g_relation_index() indexes relation FIELD with the provided
 *   equality and hash functions.  this must be done before any
 *   calls to insert are made.
 *
 * g_relation_insert() inserts a new tuple.  you are expected to
 *   provide the right number of fields.
 *
 * g_relation_delete() deletes all relations with KEY in FIELD
 * g_relation_select() returns ...
 * g_relation_count() counts ...
