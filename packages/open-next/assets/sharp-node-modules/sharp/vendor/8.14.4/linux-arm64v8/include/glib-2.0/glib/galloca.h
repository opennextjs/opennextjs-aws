/**
 * g_alloca:
 * @size: number of bytes to allocate.
 * 
 * Allocates @size bytes on the stack; these bytes will be freed when the current
 * stack frame is cleaned up. This macro essentially just wraps the alloca()
 * function present on most UNIX variants.
 * Thus it provides the same advantages and pitfalls as alloca():
 *
 * - alloca() is very fast, as on most systems it's implemented by just adjusting
 *   the stack pointer register.
 *
 * - It doesn't cause any memory fragmentation, within its scope, separate alloca()
 *   blocks just build up and are released together at function end.
 *
 * - Allocation sizes have to fit into the current stack frame. For instance in a
 *   threaded environment on Linux, the per-thread stack size is limited to 2 Megabytes,
 *   so be sparse with alloca() uses.
 *
 * - Allocation failure due to insufficient stack space is not indicated with a %NULL
 *   return like e.g. with malloc(). Instead, most systems probably handle it the same
 *   way as out of stack space situations from infinite function recursion, i.e.
 *   with a segmentation fault.
 *
 * - Allowing @size to be specified by an untrusted party would allow for them
 *   to trigger a segmentation fault by specifying a large size, leading to a
 *   denial of service vulnerability. @size must always be entirely under the
 *   control of the program.
 *
 * - Special care has to be taken when mixing alloca() with GNU C variable sized arrays.
 *   Stack space allocated with alloca() in the same scope as a variable sized array
 *   will be freed together with the variable sized array upon exit of that scope, and
 *   not upon exit of the enclosing function scope.
 * 
 * Returns: space for @size bytes, allocated on the stack
