/* Make it clear that we mean the struct with 32-bit st_size and
 * 32-bit st_*time fields as that is how the 32-bit GLib DLL normally
 * has been compiled. If you get a compiler warning when calling
 * g_stat(), do take it seriously and make sure that the type of
 * struct stat the code in GLib fills in matches the struct the type
 * of struct stat you pass to g_stat(). To avoid hassle, to get file
 * attributes just use the GIO API instead which doesn't use struct
 * stat.
 *
 * Sure, it would be nicer to use a struct with 64-bit st_size and
 * 64-bit st_*time fields, but changing that now would break ABI. And
 * in MinGW, a plain "struct stat" is the one with 32-bit st_size and
 * st_*time fields.
